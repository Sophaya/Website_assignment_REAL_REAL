 <!--introduction-->
    <h3> Introduction </h3> 
    <p> 
        Over 700 planets beyond our solarsystem have been discovered by scientists already. The majority of these are extremely hot or cold, making them unfit <br>
        for human habitation. However, there are a few, which if we were to get to them one day, could serve as our home. This page will <br>
        explore these habitable alien planets and discuss, why they are habitable, how they were discovered and how far they are from <br>
        our current home, the planet Earth. <br>

 <!-- Kepler-4526 explanation-->
 <p>
    Kepler-452b, also known as Earth's "cousin" is an alien planet located 
    approximately 1,400 light-years away in the constellation Cygnus. It is a rocky 
    exoplanet that orbits a star similar to our Sun at a distance that places it 
    within the star's habitable zone. This zone allows for the presence of liquid water, a crucial 
    ingredient for life, as it is here on Planet Earth. The exoplanet is Earth-like in size and its 
    position in the habitable zone makes it an ideal place for orgnasims to dwell. Although further 
    studies are needed to confirm its habitability and the presence of an atmosphere, Kepler-452b seems 
    to be only the beginning of an exciting journey to find an alternative home for humanity.

 <!--Kepler-186f-->
 <h3 id = "Kepler-186f"> Kepler-186f </h3>

 <img class = "pexel_images" src = "pexels-dennis-ariel-11431055.jpg" alt = "Yellow galaxy in space surrounded by stars.">

 <!--Kepler-186f explanation-->
 <p>
    Kepler-186f is another fascinating exoplanet discovery, located around 500 light-years away 
    in the constellation Cygnus. It's a significant find because it's the first Earth-sized planet 
    discovered in the habitable zone of a star other than our Sun. Kepler-186f orbits a red dwarf 
    star, Kepler-186, at a distance that allows for the possibility of liquid water, a vital part of 
    a living being's habitat. While its size and location make it an intriguing candidate for
    hosting life, its habitability is still a subject of ongoing research. The planet's potential 
    habitability underscores the vast diversity of exoplanetary environments and our continuing quest
    to better understand the conditions that might support life beyond our solar system.

 <!--Trappist-1-->

<h3 id="Trappist-1"> Trappist-1 </h3>

<img class = "pexel_images" src = "pexels-enric-cruz-lÃ³pez-6039245.jpg" alt = "Stars in purple/blue space">

<p>
    TRAPPIST-1e is one of the seven exoplanets in the TRAPPIST-1 star system, situated 
    approximately 39 light-years away from Earth in the Aquarius constellation. This rocky
    exoplanet is particularly intriguing because it falls within the habitable zone of its 
    host star, TRAPPIST-1, where conditions might be suitable for liquid water to exist. 
    This proximity to the star, combined with its Earth-like size, increases the likelihood 
    that TRAPPIST-1e could have a stable climate and potentially host the conditions necessary 
    for life as we know it. However, the planet's habitability still depends on various factors, 
    including its atmosphere and the presence of water, which continue to be subjects of 
    ngoing research and exploration. TRAPPIST-1e represents a compelling target in our quest 
    to understand the potential habitability of exoplanets beyond our solar system.
