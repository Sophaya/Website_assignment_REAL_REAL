    <h3> Introduction </h3> 
    <p> 
        Over 700 planets beyond our solarsystem have been discovered by scientists already. The majority of these are extremely hot or cold, making them unfit <br>
        for human habitation. However, there are a few, which if we were to get to them one day, could serve as our home. This page will <br>
        explore these habitable alien planets and discuss, why they are habitable, how they were discovered and how far they are from <br>
        our current home, the planet Earth. <br>
