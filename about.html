<!--Sophaya-->

<h4> Sophaya </h4>


<img class ="pexel_images" src = "pexels-pixabay-207983.jpg" alt = "Two smiley face dolls in a box." width = "600" height = "400">


<p>   Sophaya has always been an avid scholar and would love to make information available world-wide 
        through this website. She also has a dream of the whole world turning into chocolate one day.</p> 
  

<h4> Smartzypantz </h4>

    
        <img class = "pexel_images" src = "pexels-pineapple-supply-co-1071878.jpg" alt = "Drop of water falling into a pool of water." width = "600" height = "400">
        
 <p>  Smartzypantz was born smart and will always be smart. Smartzypanz loves
       travelling and adventure, often spending days in wilderness with no outside contact to immerse
       himself in nature. He then reappears spontaneously from time to time, but no one can be quite 
       sure where he is from or where he is...now....</p>
